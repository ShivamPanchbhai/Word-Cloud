# Word-Cloud
This project is completed by me under the Guidance of Coursera while doing Crash Course on Python. This project was executed using Jupyter Notebook.
Word Cloud is a data visualization technique used for representing text data in which the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance.

The main objective of this project was to make a "Word Cloud" from any source of text.

All the installs and imports script necessary for "Word Cloud" project were written already by Coursera and the uploader widget script which was used to upload the text file was also written by Coursera.

The main part of the project was writing the script which processes the text was written by me. The processing of the text involves removing punctuations, symbols and all the specified irrelevant words to filter out only pure words from the source text.
The wordcloud module will then generate the image from the frequencies of the word.
